# Overnight run, 2026-10-03 to 2026-10-04

The owner asked the lead to run autonomously overnight: "if you get blocked, move to the next item and we can discuss any blockers tomorrow morning." This file is the running log, kept by Claude Opus 5.5 as lead.

## Blockers for the owner

| # | Decision | What it blocks | Lead recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | **O7, hostile-input confinement** (M3-PLAN "O7") | Acceptance of M3-L, the provider-protocol law; provider launch; M3-CF's successors. Drafting continues. | <ul><li>Landlock + seccomp + no network on AL2023; Seatbelt on macOS.</li><li>Where confinement is unavailable, disclose it in the result and require containers for untrusted pull requests.</li><li>Run repository code only with RepoExecutionGrantV2, inside confinement.</li></ul> |
| B2 | **The gating precision bar** (quality plan D4 revisit; harness design §8) | Q2 acceptance for gating rules. Nothing tonight. | <ul><li>Observed precision ≥ 0.99, plus a 95% cluster-aware lower bound ≥ 0.95 (about 59 independent repository families with zero errors).</li><li>Rules graduate from advisory to gating as evidence from T2 and T3 accumulates.</li></ul> |

## Work log

Times are local.

- **Session restart.** X9-6's lead sets, lanes and release absence had completed: storage 381/381, host 98/98, union 383/383 killed, repetitions agree. The real `check` correctly refuses on the uncommitted worktree.
  - Its review request was pinned and sent to Grok (arch `2c44a5e46`).
  - Lead recommendation: Grok reruns once, on the integrated commit.
- **X9-6 accepted and integrated.** Grok gave ACCEPT-UNIT with no findings, and X9-6 is integrated as product main `3d2d5b5` (commit C). Grok chose to run its full sets once, on C.
- **Final evidence run started on C:** release absence, two full sets across both targets, then the real `check`.
- **Started in parallel, with no machine load:**
  - M3-T2b, corpus completion, for GROK2;
  - M3-I1, the preview-pack IR freeze and contract-successor draft, for CODEX2;
  - M3-L, the protocol law draft. Its acceptance is gated on O7.
