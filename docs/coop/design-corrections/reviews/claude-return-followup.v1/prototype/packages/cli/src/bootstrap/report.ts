/**
 * report — TTY/CI guarded auto-open of the HTML report after a
 * tool run.
 *
 * Tools call this through `ctx.maybeOpenReport`. Lives in `bootstrap/`
 * because the launch policy (TTY, JSON-mode, CI vars, `--open`) is
 * tool-agnostic.
 *
 * Audit 2026-05-29 (L2): the auto-open path now goes through the CLI's
 * own cross-tool composition (`composeAndWriteReport`) instead of
 * dynamically importing fitness's old report opener. The CLI is the
 * report composition root — it walks every registered tool's
 * `collectReportData` contribution and merges them. This removes the
 * last `cli → @opensip-cli/fitness` dynamic import from this path and
 * keeps fitness decoupled from graph.
 *
 * Extracted from the prior `render-helpers.ts` so the pure renderer
 * (`render.ts`) and this report auto-open helper can each evolve
 * without dragging the other along. Audit 2026-05-23 M4. The first-
 * party live-view map (`live-views.ts`) was deleted in Layer 5 Phase 3
 * (audit 2026-05-22 F3) — tool packages now own their own renderers.
