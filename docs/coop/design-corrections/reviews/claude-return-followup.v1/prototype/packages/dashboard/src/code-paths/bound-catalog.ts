/**
 * bound-catalog — project the graph catalog down to what the report actually
 * renders, and bound what remains.
 *
 * The report used to inline the ENTIRE persisted catalog contract. On this
 * repository (17.5k functions) that produced a **293 MB** `latest.html`: one
 * 306 MB `<script>` of which the browser reads a small fraction. It could not
 * be opened, could not be attached to a PR, and took the dashboard test suite
 * down with it by exhausting the jsdom heap. An empty report is ~700 KB.
 *
 * Two independent problems, fixed in order:
 *
 * 1. **Waste.** The catalog contract is a STORAGE shape, sized for the engine,
 *    MCP evidence, and incremental rebuilds. The browser reads a much smaller
 *    shape (`CatalogLike` / `OccLike` in `client/code-paths-types.ts`). It never
 *    touches `semanticFacts` (204 MB here), `reExports`, three of the four
 *    `features` maps, or five per-occurrence fields. Projecting to exactly the
 *    client's contract is lossless for the report and took 305 MB → 47 MB.
 *
 * 2. **Unboundedness.** 47 MB is still not a document you send anyone, and it
 *    grows with the repository. So the projection is then bounded by a byte
 *    budget, dropping the least important functions first — ranked by blast
 *    radius, the same signal the graph rules use for "what matters here".
 *
 * Truncation is a VISIBLE state, never a silent one: `omittedFunctions` rides
 * into the page and the Code Paths panel says so. A report that quietly showed
 * 5,000 of 28,327 functions would be exactly the "empty result that looks like
 * a clean result" this product exists to prevent.
 *
 * Mirrors `change-impact/bound-runs.ts`, which bounds the Change Impact models
 * the same way (ADR-0156).
